        <p>"In 1637 the Pequot Massacre took place, when over 700 Native men, women and children were slaughtered in
            what's now known as Mystic, Connecticut.
            The following day, the governor declared a day of thanksfiving and held a feast to celebrate their
            victories in battle.
            Thirty-nine years later in Massachuetts, the colonists declared a day of public celebration and
            thanksgiving, saying, there now scarce reamains
            a name or family of them 'Natives' but are either slain, captivated or fled, right after the slaughtering
            of a tribe including
            the beheading of Wampanoag chief Metacom, which reamined on display for 24 years after King Philip's war.
            It was not
            unitl 1863 that Abraham Lincoln officially declared it a national holiday, in the same year the Sioux were
            being removed
            from Minnesota, during which the bounty for a Sioux scalp was $25." - Allen Salway, Paper Magazine
